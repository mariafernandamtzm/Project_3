## Objectives 

1. Investigate the relationship between the C02 Emissions and Climate change: Analyze the historical trend of CO2 emissions from agricultural activities and their correlation with the average yearly temperature increase. Assess the role of agricultural emissions in contributing to climate change and identify potential feedback loops.

2. Analyze the Contribution of Different Agricultural Activities to CO2 Emissions: Investigate the relative impact of various agricultural activities on CO2 emissions. Identify the major contributors and their significance in the agri-food sector's overall greenhouse gas emissions.

## How to be part of the change:

Smart Contracts for Sustainable Practices: Develop smart contracts that incentivize and reward sustainable agricultural practices to reduce CO2 emissions. Integrate these contracts with the forecasting models to evaluate the potential impact of sustainable interventions on emissions reduction.

Stakeholder Collaboration: Engage with policymakers, climate scientists, environmental researchers, and agricultural stakeholders to ensure the relevance and accuracy of the analysis.
Collect feedback and suggestions to improve the forecasting models and inform policy recommendations.
