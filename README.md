## Project 3: README
Welcome to Project 3's README file. This document provides an overview of the technologies, languages, and the objectives of the project.

## Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Data Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Data Visualization: Tableau
Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of Project 3 are as follows:

1. Investigate the Relationship between CO2 Emissions and Climate Change
Analyze the historical trend of CO2 emissions from agricultural activities.
Correlate CO2 emissions with the average yearly temperature increase.
Assess the role of agricultural emissions in contributing to climate change.
Identify potential feedback loops between CO2 emissions and climate change.
2. Analyze the Contribution of Different Agricultural Activities to CO2 Emissions
Investigate the relative impact of various agricultural activities on CO2 emissions.
Identify major contributors to CO2 emissions within the agri-food sector.
Determine the significance of each contributor to the sector's overall greenhouse gas emissions.
How to Be Part of the Change
As a part of this project's initiative, we encourage you to contribute to positive change by creating a donation list based on your country. Identify reputable non-profit organizations that focus on climate change mitigation, sustainable agriculture, and environmental conservation. Your donations can support these organizations in their efforts to combat CO2 emissions and promote a greener future.

The model for initiating conversations related to this cause will be deployed through the AWS platform, allowing for seamless and efficient communication among individuals interested in driving change.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle: Agri-Food CO2 Emission Dataset.

## Conclusion
Project 3 aims to shed light on the relationship between agricultural CO2 emissions and climate change. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques, we strive to provide valuable insights into the impact of agricultural practices on the environment. Through our collaboration and the support of AWS, we hope to inspire positive actions and contributions towards a more sustainable future.
