## Objectives 

1. Investigate the relationship between the C02 Emissions and Climate change: Analyze the historical trend of CO2 emissions from agricultural activities and their correlation with the average yearly temperature increase. Assess the role of agricultural emissions in contributing to climate change and identify potential feedback loops.

2. Forecast Future CO2 Emissions from the Agri-food Sector: Utilize machine learning techniques to forecast future CO2 emissions from the agri-food sector. Develop predictive models based on historical data to project emissions under different scenarios and policy interventions.

3. Analyze the Contribution of Different Agricultural Activities to CO2 Emissions: Investigate the relative impact of various agricultural activities on CO2 emissions. Identify the major contributors and their significance in the agri-food sector's overall greenhouse gas emissions.
